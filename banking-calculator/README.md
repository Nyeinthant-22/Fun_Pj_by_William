## Mathematical Formulas

### Simple Interest
```
SI = (P √ó R √ó T) / 100
Total Amount = P + SI
```

### Compound Interest
```
A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)
Compound Interest = A - P
```

### Loan Payment (Monthly)
```
M = P √ó [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]
Where: r = monthly rate, n = total payments
```

### Savings Goal (Time Calculation)
```
n = ln(1 + (FV √ó r) / PMT) / ln(1 + r)
Where: FV = future value, PMT = payment, r = monthly rate
```
